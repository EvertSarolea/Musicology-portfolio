## Corpus introduction for Computational musicology
### Subject
The corpus of this project contains all of the songs of the Eurovision Song Contest since its first edition in 1956. Although most songs can't exactly be considered high brow music, I have been a big fan of the show since my childhood. Therefore, this course project seemed like the perfect opportunity to dive deeper into the music behind all the dancing, costumes and fireworks. From a musicological perspective, I thing Eurovision is interesting for multiple reasons. To start, it has been consistently held (almost) every year for over 60 years, thereby providing a historical perspective on evolution of taste on the European continent. It contains the submissions of many European countries, enabling comparisons between different countries regarding preference of genre, instruments e.a. And finally, since it is a contest after all, I thought it might be interesting to discover whether certain musical qualities hold the key to succes for a song. 
### Possible comparisons
As mentioned before, it might be interesting to investigate how musical taste, at least as far as Eurovision is concerned, has developed over the years. A possible way to do this is to divide the contest in three periods (early, middle, late) and compare them on multiple attributes. Another possible comparison is the one between countries, or possible Europe (e.g. West, South, East).
