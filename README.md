## Corpus introduction for Computational musicology
### Subject
The corpus of this project contains all of the songs of the Eurovision Song Contest since its first edition in 1956. Although most songs can't exactly be considered high brow music, I have been a big fan of the show since my childhood. Therefore, this course project seemed like the perfect opportunity to dive deeper into the music behind all the dancing, costumes and fireworks. From a musicological perspective, I thing Eurovision is interesting for multiple reasons. To start, it has been consistently held (almost) every year since 1956, thereby providing a historical picture of evolution of taste on the European continent.
