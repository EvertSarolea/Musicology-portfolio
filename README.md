## Corpus introduction for Computational musicology
The corpus of this project contains all of the songs of the Eurovision Song Contest since its first edition in 1956. Although most songs can't exactly be considered high brow music, I have been a big fan of the show since my childhood. Therefore, this course project seemed like the perfect opportunity to dive deeper into the music behind all the dancing, costumes and fireworks. 

From a musicological perspective, I thing Eurovision is interesting for multiple reasons. To start, it has been consistently held (almost) every year for over 60 years, thereby providing a historical perspective on evolution of taste on the European continent. Secondly, it might be interesting to investigate how submissions can be grouped in different genres, use of instruments e.a., enabling comparisons between different countries. Instead of countries, it is also possible to look at regions e.g. Northwest, South and Eastern Europe. And finally, since it is a contest after all, I thought it might be interesting to discover whether certain musical qualities hold the key to succes for a song.

Choosing the Eurovision song contest as corpus also has some constraints, mostly concerning the generalizability of its contents. Eurovision songs aren’t necessarily representative for a country’s or European music taste in general, if there even is such a thing as a country's general music taste. Secondly, analysing which qualities make a song successful in the contest might be difficult due to confounding and external factors such as draw and non-musical elements of the performance (dancing, decor etc.). In addition, most songs in the corpus aren't life recordings of the actual performances, so the corpus doesn't take the effect of actual performance into account.

Nevertheless, I still believe analysing Eurovision songs can lead to interesting results. Regardless of how generalizable these results are to (European) music in general, Eurovision has been such a longlasting, popular and large event that a more musicological investigation into its songs is justified.
