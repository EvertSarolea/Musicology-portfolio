# Musicology-portfolio
## Corpus introduction for Computational musicology
The corpus of this project contains all of the songs of the Eurovision Song Contest since its first edition in 1956. Although most songs can't exactly be considered high brow music, I have been a big fan of the show since my childhood. Therefore, this course project seemed like the perfect opportunity to dive deeper into the music behind all the dancing, costumes and fireworks. 

From a musicological perspective, I thing Eurovision is interesting for multiple reasons. To start, it has been consistently held (almost) every year for over 60 years, thereby providing a historical perspective on evolution of taste on the European continent. It contains the submissions of many European countries, enabling comparisons between different countries regarding preference of genre, instruments e.a. Instead of countries, it is also possible to look at regions e.g. Northwest, South and Eastern Europe. And finally, since it is a contest after all, I thought it might be interesting to discover whether certain musical qualities hold the key to succes for a song.
Choosing the Eurovision song contest as corpus also has some constraints. Most importantly, it probably isn't a very representative
